# Website Template

As my knowledge of HTML and CSS grow, I want to be able to have a website folder template that I can go to on a fly. 
I will be updating this as I gain more knowledge on the things I want to always start my websites with. The css and javacsript files
have been linked to the HTML template. I have also set up an images folder and audio folder to keep it organized.

--------- Update ---------------
Recently added a Template for sites that utilize bootstrap/css/js/html as well. Its linked together and ready for development.
